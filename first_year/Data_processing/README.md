# Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) Challenge - Interspeech 2020

This repository contains the datasets and scripts required for the DNS challenge. For more details about the challenge, please visit https://dns-challenge.azurewebsites.net/ and refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2001/2001.08662.pdf).

## Repo details:
* The **datasets** directory contains the clean speech and noise clips.
* The **NSNet-baseline** directory contains the inference scripts and the ONNX model for the baseline Speech Enhancer called **Noise Suppression Net (NSNet)** 
* **noisyspeech_synthesizer_singleprocess.py** - is used to synthesize noisy-clean speech pairs for training purposes.
* **noisyspeech_synthesizer.cfg** - is the configuration file used to synthesize the data. Users are required to accurately specify different parameters.
* **audiolib.py** - contains modules required to synthesize datasets
* **utils.py** - contains some utility functions required to synthesize the data
* **unit_tests_synthesizer.py** - contains the unit tests to ensure sanity of the data

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.0 and above
- Soundfile (pip install pysoundfile), librosa

## Usage:
1. Install librosa 
```
pip install librosa
```
2. Install Git Large File Storage for faster download of the datasets.
```
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.wav"
git add .gitattributes
```
3. Clone the repository. 
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge DNS-Challenge
```
4. Edit **noisyspeech_synthesizer.cfg** to include the paths to clean speech and noise directories. Also, specify the paths to the destination directories and store logs.
5. Create dataset 
```
python noisyspeech_synthesizer_multiprocessing.py
```
